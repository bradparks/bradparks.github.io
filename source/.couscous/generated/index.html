<h2 id="moms-turning-70-this-january-2">Mom's turning 70 this January 2!</h2>
<p><strong><em>We'd like to help her celebrate by getting 70 people to each write her a special note for her birthday, a note on a recipe card!</em></strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™re going to take all the recipe cards, put them together in a hand crafted recipe box, wrap them with a beautiful bow and card, and give them to her on her birthday!</p>
<h3 id="now-of-course-we-want-to-keep-this-a-secret---so-dont-tell-her--">Now of course we want to keep this a secret - so DON'T tell her ;-)</h3>
<h3 id="who-should-write-the-notes-anyone">Who should write the notes? Anyone!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anyone that has either meant something to her, or she's meant something to them.</li>
<li>A kid she taught in school.</li>
<li>A friend she knew in high school, a childhood friend - Anyone! </li>
<li>So definitely pass the idea on to whoever you think would like to help us celebrate her in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think someone should know about this, let them know by sending them to this page.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-card-you-can-put-whatever-you-want">On the card, you can put whatever you want...</h3>
<ul>
<li>A story about how she's helped you out at some time in your life
<img style="border:0; width:200px; padding:30px;float: right;" src="box1.jpg"></li>
<li>A fond memory you have of her</li>
<li>A <em>picture</em> you know she'd love to see</li>
<li>A note to tell her how much you care for her </li>
<li>Anything at all that you think she might like to read or remember on her birthday</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-how-does-this-work">So how does this work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a recipe card, picture or index card that is <strong><em>no bigger than 4x6 inches in size</em></strong>. This is important to make sure they all fit in the recipe box.</li>
<li>Use more than one card if you want... Think it'd take 10 to tell your story? Then use 10.  If we need to get a bigger box, we'll get a bigger box!</li>
<li>
<p>Tell others about it and get them to write her a note too ;-) Just send them to this page (<a href="http://www.bradparks.com">http://www.bradparks.com</a>), or get them to join the following private Facebook group, so we can talk about it some more:</p>
