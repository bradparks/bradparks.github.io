<h2 id="moms-turning-70-this-january-2">Mom's turning 70 this January 2!</h2>
<p>As you all know, mom is one of the most humble people you'll ever meet. We wanted to throw her a party for her 70th birthday, but of course she doesn't want a party!</p>
<p>But we want to show her just how special she is, and how much she means to those around her.</p>
<p><strong><em>To do this, we'd like to help her celebrate by getting at least 70 people to write her a special card/note/letter for her birthday!</em></strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™re going to take all these cards, put them together in a hand crafted box, wrap them with a beautiful bow, and give them to her on her birthday!</p>
<h3 id="now-of-course-we-want-to-keep-this-a-secret---so-dont-tell-her--">Now of course we want to keep this a secret - so DON'T tell her ;-)</h3>
<h3 id="who-should-write-the-cards-anyone">Who should write the cards? Anyone!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anyone that has either meant something to her, or she's meant something to them.</li>
<li>A kid she taught in school.</li>
<li>A friend she knew in high school, a childhood friend - Anyone! </li>
<li>So definitely pass the idea on to whoever you think would like to help us celebrate her in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think someone should know about this, let them know by sending them to this page (<a href="http://www.bradparks.com">http://www.bradparks.com</a>). </p>
<h3 id="on-the-card-you-can-put-whatever-you-want">On the card, you can put whatever you want...</h3>
<ul>
<li>A story about how she's helped you out at some time in your life</li>
<li>A fond memory you have of her</li>
<li>A <em>picture</em> you know she'd love to see</li>
<li>A note to tell her how much you care for her </li>
<li>Anything at all that you think she might like to read or remember on her birthday</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-how-does-this-work">So how does this work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write her a letter or card, or give us a picture you think she'd like to see. Any size at all, but preferably under a standard envelope size.</li>
<li>Seal the letter if you like - we're not going to read them unless you want us to. We just want it to be a beautiful surprise for her birthday.</li>
<li>
<p>Tell others about it and get them to write her a card too ;-) Just send them to this page (<a href="http://www.bradparks.com">http://www.bradparks.com</a>), or get them to join the following private Facebook group, so we can talk about it some more:</p>
